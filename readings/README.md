# Readings

Python is a very popular programming language, and there are many, many books covering its use for all sorts of things. Here are a few texts that may be most useful for beginners.

## Recommended

**[Python for Everybody](https://www.py4e.com/book) - Charles 'Dr Chuck' Severance**. An excellent introduction to Python, and to computer programming in general, aimed at complete beginners. The book is available for free [online](https://www.py4e.com/html3/), including exercises, but you can also order a cheap hard copy. Dr Chuck is an excellent instructor and you may also find his [video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlRFEj9H3Oj7Bp8-DfGpfAfDBiblRfl5p) helpful.

## Extra

### Beginner

**[Think Python](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/) - Allen B Downey**. Dr Chuck's *Python for Everybody* is a 'remix' of this earlier book, with extra emphasis on teaching to beginners and on practical applications such as web apps and databases. *Think Python* includes a lot of the same material, but with more detail on the abstract computer science of programming, and slightly less emphasis on applications. It is also available for free [online](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/index.html), along with exercises and examples.

**[Python Crash Course](https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse2e) - Eric Matthes**. Also for beginners, but longer and more comprehensive than the other two beginner texts. Provides many clear 'recipes' for basic programming tasks, and includes good explanations of common problems and errors.

### Advanced

**[Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) - Jake VanderPlas**. A comprehensive introduction to working with data in Python, including machine learning. Assumes the reader is already familiar with Python.

**[The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python](https://docs.python-guide.org/) - Kenneth Reitz & Tanya Schlusser**. Focuses on the processes of developing, documenting, and packaging Python programs, assuming that the reader already knows how to create a program.
