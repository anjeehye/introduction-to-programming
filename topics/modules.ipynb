    "In the [previous lesson](functions.ipynb) we learned how to define our own [functions](extras/glossary.md#function). I mentioned the possibility of re-using functions in a different file from the file in which the functions are defined. This is the main thing that we will learn about in this lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may reasonably ask why we would want to do this. If we are writing a program that requires one or more custom-defined functions, why not just define them in the same file that contains the program in which they are used? After all, this simpler one-file structure is the way that the [fun_facts.py](examples/fun_facts.py) example program is organized, and that program was written by a well-respected expert programmer.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a simple program like *fun_facts.py*, a single file is fine, and is even a good idea. Multiple files are unnecessary for simple, short programs. But for more complex programs, separating functions off from the rest of the program has some advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Clarity**. The functions file shows the algorithmic workings of each component of the program, but the main program file shows how those components are combined to create the overall program structure. We know which file to go to if we want to change either the overall structure or the details of the program.\n",
    "* **Portability**. A file that contains only functions can be re-used by a different program. The alternative, copying and pasting the function definition into every program file that needs it, is prone to mistakes and makes our programs inflexible ('[DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself)').\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python file that contains an actual program that will 'do something' when run is often termed a [script](extras/glossary.md#script), because it is providing the Python [interpreter](extras/glossary.md#interpreter) with line-by-line instructions telling it what to do, like the script for an actor. A file that instead contains only function definitions (and possibly also some variables) intended to be used elsewhere is often termed a [module](extras/glossary.md#module). A basic structure for a simple multi-file Python program is to have one module file providing some functions, along with a script file (the 'main' file) that gets those functions and actually does something with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how this works, using the [initials.py](examples/initials.py) file that we saw in the previous lesson. Take a look at the example program [ids.py](examples/ids.py). This program makes use of the `get_initials()` function that is defined in *initials.py*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Imports\n",
    "\n",
    "We can almost already create a multi-file program given what we have learned so far, and there is very little in *ids.py* that is unfamiliar. We know how to use functions, and we know how to use additional [control statements](extras/glossary.md#control) to determine what actions are taken when, how often, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only new ingredient is how to 'get' the contents of one file into another. This is fairly easy. The [keyword](extras/glossary.md#keyword) `import` runs another Python file and then makes its contents (i.e. any functions or variables in it) available in the current file. The [syntax](extras/glossary.md#syntax) for importing the contents of a file is simply to write `import` followed by the name of the file, without the *.py* file extension.\n",

By keeping imported things in a separate namespace, such accidental overwrites are avoided. It is entirely possible to import a module (for example called *my_module.py*) containing a function or variable called `x` and also to have something called `x` in your main program. The former will be available as `my_module.x` whereas the latter will be available simply as `x`.\n",
