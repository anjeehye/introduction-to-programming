## machine code

Instructions for a computer in the form of a sequence of numbers, each of which refers to one operation that the computer can carry out. Modern computer programmers almost never write machine code. Instead, they write commands in plain text, and an intermediate program converts these commands into machine code so that the computer can execute them.
