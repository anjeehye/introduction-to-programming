    "\n",
    "Thus far, our programs have interacted with the wider world only via the `input()` function, for getting information from a human being, and via the `print()` function, for displaying text results on the screen. By now you will probably be fairly tired of this pattern. Maybe more than once you have run your program, then forgotten that it requires you to type some input into the console, and so spent several minutes idly wondering why nothing is happening. Or you have repeatedly hit the wrong keys on your keyboard by accident and been treated to some infuriating error messages. So you will be glad to hear that we are (mostly) going to leave the `input()` function behind from now on. We have really mainly been using `input()` as a crutch, a simple form of interactivity to get us started with programming. Most real programs don't use `input()` at all, or only sparingly. Instead, they have other methods for getting hold of external data. The first of these methods that we will learn about is reading in data from a file stored on our computer. We will also learn a bit about how to write the results of our programs into new files.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are lots of different file formats, each of which stores information in different ways. For example, Microsoft Word *docx* files store text along with various additional pieces of information about how that text is to be displayed, *jpg* image files store information about the colors of the pixels of an image, and some files, such as *exe* files, store entire programs in a form that it is not feasible for a human being to read and interpret. When working with files, we will need to be aware of the nature of the particular file format we are dealing with, and instruct Python to read or write it appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Text files\n",
    "\n",
    "We will consider mainly files that store data as text, and come to non-text file formats in later lessons when they become relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plain text\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with a file format that is fairly easy to deal with: plain text. Plain text files just store text characters (although as we will see, there are some subtleties to consider even here). We can open plain text files and view their contents in a normal text editor.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to follow along with the examples in this lesson, make sure you have first downloaded the [example programs and data files](examples/data/intro_prog_examples.zip) for the class and that you have unzipped this file in your working directory so that 'data' is a subdirectory of your working directory. Like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/data_subdirectory.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now find the example text file [melville-moby_dick.txt](examples/data/melville-moby_dick.txt). The *txt* extension indicates that this file should contain plain text. It contains the full text of the novel *Moby Dick* by Herman Melville.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note that one of the many profoundly stupid default options in Windows is that file extensions such as *.py*, *.txt*, etc. are not displayed, so the file may appear only as *melville-moby_dick* in your file explorer, but its name is still *melville-moby_dick.txt*, and this is how Python and other programs will want you to refer to it. See [here](https://fileinfo.com/help/windows_10_show_file_extensions) for how to change this option if you would prefer to be able to see file extensions.)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can open a plain text file in your preferred text editor. Since the editor in Spyder is just a fancy text editor, you can open it there if you like. This might even be the most convenient way to view it, since you will have it open just next to the Spyder console and will be able to see its contents as you try out the example commands below for opening and reading the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reading\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now open the file from within a Python program. There is a [built-in](extras/glossary.md#builtin) function for this, called simply `open()`. The input argument is a string containing the [path](extras/glossary.md#path) to the file we want to open. If the file is located in the same directory as our program, then the path is simply the name of the file. But in this case, the file is located in a directory called 'data', so we need to put this together with the file name to build the full path (Take a look back at the use of `os.path` [in the previous lesson](standard_library.ipynb#Paths) if you need to remind yourself how this works).\n",
    "\n",
    "We should [assign](extras/glossary.md#assignment) the result of calling the `open()` function into a new variable, so that we can then work with it in the rest of our program. If we are working with just a single file, `f` is a convenient choice of variable name. We will use that. But note that if we were working with multiple files it would be better for the clarity of our program if we chose a variable name that says something about which particular file we have opened."

    "The nature of the control statement in this case is to make the indented block of commands into a 'context' for a variable. Following the `with` keyword is a [call](extras/glossary.md#call) to the function that creates the variable (in this case the `open()` function). Then the `as` keyword just gives the variable a name (in this case we have chosen `f`). This variable name can then use in the indented block of commands.\n",

    "The `with` statement then takes care of any 'cleaning up' that needs to be done with the variable once we have finished with it. In this case the cleaning up includes closing the file.

Python looks at the variable and runs one of its hidden 'special methods'. Remember what we learned about these special methods back [in the lesson on modules](modules.ipynb#Special-methods).

    "### Encodings\n",
    "\n",
    "We are not done with text files yet. Before we move on to consider a few special kinds of text file, we need to learn about something that is a little tedious but is very important: File encodings. Not knowing about file encodings can be the source of a great deal of frustration when working with text data. To understand what file encodings are, we need to take a very brief aside to consider a tiny bit of the history of computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you are probably aware, a computer does not actually just store text characters as characters the way they appear on the screen. Computers have no built-in concept of letters or characters and they do not somehow 'draw' the letters anywhere in their memory. Instead, computers store everything as numbers. (Even this is something of a simplification; computers store sequences of signals that are either 'on' or 'off', and intermediate systems can interpret combinations of these signals as numbers. But this is more detail than we need for now.) So in order to store text, a computer needs some way of translating each text character into a unique number. A system for translating text characters into numbers is known as a text [encoding](extras/glossary.md#encoding), because it turns text into a computer 'code'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Translating text characters back and forth into numbers for our computer each time we write or read text data should be no problem, so long as it is always clear which numbers stand for which characters, in other words, which encoding we should use. When reading a text file, we just need to make sure to read it using the same encoding as was used to write it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ASCII\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, a standard encoding was agreed upon in the early days of computerized data exchange, so that everybody could save their bawdy jokes to a magnetic tape or floppy disk and mail it to their friends, sure in the knowledge that other computers would translate the computer code into text correctly. This standard encoding is commonly known as the American Standard Code for Information Interchange, or [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, ASCII only specified a system for the characters that Americans most like to use. These included just the 26 letters of the English version of the Latin alphabet (their lowercase and uppercase versions), along with digits, some punctuation, a few special characters like the [newline](extras/glossary.md#newline) that we learned about above, and the cheeseburger emoji.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are reading or writing text files that we are sure contain only the characters defined in ASCII, then we do not usually need to worry about the file encoding; computers will tend to agree on how to read and write such text files without being given any additional instructions about encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### UTF-8\n",
    "\n",
    "ASCII is a bit restrictive when it comes to handling text in general. It doesn't even include accented characters, and even in an English-language text we might occasionally want to use these, for example if we are being pretentious and slipping in a few French phrases like *trompe-l'œil* or *ouh là là*, or writing about someone with a non-English name, like the singer Michael Bublé.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, there is no universal system agreed upon for encoding the characters that are not covered by ASCII. As computers became more common outside the English-speaking world, each group of users that wanted to exchange text containing non-English characters went ahead and developed their own encodings. The result is that today there are various different ways of storing text on a computer if that text contains non-ASCII characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "There has since been some movement towards standardization, but it is incomplete. The in-theory most widely agreed-upon encoding for non-ASCII characters is an encoding called [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) (8-bit Unicode Transformation Format) and this is by far the most commonly used encoding for web pages. However, some of the most popular [operating systems](extras/glossary.md#OS), Windows and macOS, do not use UTF-8 by default when reading or writing text files. Instead, they use a variety of other encodings.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Locales\n",
    "\n",
    "How does Python know which encoding to use when we read and write text files? As you may have noticed when we looked at the [Python documentation page for `open()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open), there is an `encoding` [argument](extras/glossary.md#argument) to the `open()` function. We can use this to ensure that `open()` uses a particular encoding when reading or writing a file. But in the examples above we didn't enter anything for the `encoding` argument. So what encoding did `open()` use? By default, it uses whatever the computer's [operating system](extras/glossary.md#OS) says is the current user's preferred encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might not be aware that you have a preferred encoding, but your computer will almost certainly have chosen one for you when you set your preferred language. It stores this and other preferences concerning language and location together in a bundle of information often termed your [locale](extras/glossary.md). Your user locale usually contains information about your time zone, location, language, and so on, and various programs may make use of the information in your locale to customize your user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `locale` module from Python's [standard library](standard_library.ipynb) allows you to access this information from within a Python program. The `getpreferredencoding()` function will tell you what encoding you apparently prefer:"

If you ran some of the examples yourself on your own computer, Python may have been using a different encoding behind the scenes. This is unlikely to have made much practical difference.

All of the examples above used only ASCII characters (the *Moby Dick* file also contains only ASCII characters).\n",
