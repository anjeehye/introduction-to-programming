    "Thus far, our programs have interacted with the wider world only via the `input()` function, for getting information from a human being, and via the `print()` function, for displaying text results on the screen. By now you will probably be fairly tired of this pattern. Maybe more than once you have run your program, then forgotten that it requires you to type some input into the console, and so spent several minutes idly wondering why nothing is happening. Or you have repeatedly hit the wrong keys on your keyboard by accident and been treated to some infuriating error messages. So you will be glad to hear that we are (mostly) going to leave the `input()` function behind from now on. We have really mainly been using `input()` as a crutch, a simple form of interactivity to get us started with programming. Most real programs don't use `input()` at all, or only sparingly. Instead, they have other methods for getting hold of external data. The first of these methods that we will learn about is reading in data from a file stored on our computer. We will also learn a bit about how to write the results of our programs into new files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## File formats\n",
    "\n",
    "There are lots of different file formats, each of which stores information in different ways. For example, Microsoft Word *docx* files store text along with various additional pieces of information about how that text is to be displayed, *jpg* image files store information about the colors of the pixels of an image, and some files, such as *exe* files, store entire programs in a form that it is not feasible for a human being to read and interpret. When working with files, we will need to be aware of the nature of the particular file format we are dealing with, and instruct Python to read, or write, it appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plain text\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with a file format that is fairly easy to deal with: plain text. Plain text files just store text characters (although as we will see, there are some subtleties to consider even here). We can open plain text files and view their contents in a normal text editor.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to follow along with the examples in this lesson, make sure you have first downloaded the [example programs and data files](examples/data/intro_prog_examples.zip) for the class and that you have unzipped this file in your working directory so that 'data' is a subdirectory of your working directory. Like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/data_subdirectory.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now find the example text file [melville-moby_dick.txt](examples/data/melville-moby_dick.txt). The *txt* extension indicates that this file should contain plain text. It contains the full text of the novel *Moby Dick* by Herman Melville.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note that one of the many profoundly stupid default options in Windows is that file extensions such as *.py*, *.txt*, etc. are not displayed, so the file may appear only as *melville-moby_dick* in your file explorer, but its name is still *melville-moby_dick.txt*, and this is how Python and other programs will want you to refer to it. See [here](https://fileinfo.com/help/windows_10_show_file_extensions) for how to change this option if you would prefer to be able to see file extensions.)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can open a plain text file in your preferred text editor. Since the editor in Spyder is just a fancy text editor, you can open it there if you like. This might even be the most convenient way to view it, since you will have it open just next to the Spyder console and will be able to see its contents as you try out the example commands below for opening and reading the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reading\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now open the file from within a Python program. There is a [built-in](extras/glossary.md#builtin) function for this, called simply `open()`. The input argument is a string containing the [path](extras/glossary.md#path) to the file we want to open. If the file is located in the same directory as our program, then the path is simply the name of the file. But in this case, the file is located in a directory called 'data', so we need to put this together with the file name to build the full path (Take a look back at the use of `os.path` [in the previous lesson](standard_library.ipynb#Paths) if you need to remind yourself how this works).\n",
    "\n",
    "We should [assign](extras/glossary.md#assignment) the result of calling the `open()` function into a new variable, so that we can then work with it in the rest of our program. If we are working with just a single file, `f` is a convenient choice of variable name. We will use that. But note that if we were working with multiple files it would be better for the clarity of our program if we chose a variable name that says something about which particular file we have opened."
