But appearances can occasionally be deceptive. For example, the `street_number` variable above is a string that happens to contain digits. These can occur from time to time in programming, in cases where the digits do not really represent a mathematical quantity or might sometimes need to have extra non-number characters added to them (for example, Sherlock Holmes lives at house number 221b, which we can't represent and manipulate as an actual number).\n",

    "Python's occasional flexibility about data types is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it allows for some concise intuitive commands, such as using `+` to combine strings or `*` to repeat them. But on the other hand, it means that we can occasionally make some big mistakes in our programs without immediately becoming aware of it. For example, if we found that `street_number` had been entered incorrectly and in fact needed an extra zero adding to it, then we might be tempted to multiply it by 10 in order to achieve this. Python would give no warning and would go ahead with what we asked even though the result is not what we want. In this case, our program might end up sending somebody's automated delivery a lot further down the street than we intended."
