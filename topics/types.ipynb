On the one hand, it allows for some concise intuitive commands, such as using `+` to combine strings or `*` to repeat them. But on the other hand, it means that we can occasionally make some big mistakes in our programs without immediately becoming aware of it. For example, if we found that `street_number` had been entered incorrectly and in fact needed an extra zero adding to it, then we might be tempted to multiply it by 10 in order to achieve this. Python would give no warning and would go ahead with what we asked even though the result is not what we want.
