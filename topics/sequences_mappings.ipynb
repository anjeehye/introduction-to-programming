    "Understanding the reason for this behavior takes us into some of the details of how computers work. When we create a list (or a tuple), it takes up some space in our computer's memory. Although a decent modern computer usually has squigabytes upon squigabytes of memory, the amount is still limited, and not all of that memory will be accessible for Python, as it will be in use by other programs (or by the many viruses that have infected your computer). So if we are working with an extremely large sequence of numbers, for example in a big data analysis, we might prefer to generate each of those numbers one by one, process them, then discard them, rather than first storing them all in memory.\n",
