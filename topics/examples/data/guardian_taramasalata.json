          "body": "<p>Welcome to gastronomic hell. Or, to be more exact, seat 24, carriage C, on the 11am to Bristol Temple Meads. For it is autumn and I am travelling again, from one end of the United Kingdom to the other. There will be planes, trains and automobiles and while punctuality can\u2019t be guaranteed, one thing is certain: the eating options will be truly awful. We like to think we have gone through a food revolution in this country over the past few decades and in terms of restaurants, and availability of ingredients, we have. But start travelling by public transport or, God help you, pull into a motorway services, and it becomes clear that revolution is still at the Molotov-cocktail-throwing stage.</p> <p>In Bristol or Peckham or Ancoats right now it\u2019s all \u2019nduja and seared hispi cabbage and roasted golden beetroot with whipped feta. Meanwhile, on the 11am to Temple Meads it\u2019s \u201cWould you like to avail yourself of our coffee and Twix deal for \u00a33?\u201d and \u201cJust how bad would you like to feel about yourself today?\u201d The fact is you can have anything you like when you\u2019re on the move in the UK as long as it\u2019s a bolus of oil-drenched carbs. There are sugar-spiked muffins, and dismal croissants so flaccid no form of culinary Viagra would ever get them up again. The buffet car sandwiches taste of profit margin and old age. The \u201chealthy option\u201d on board is a bag of salted peanuts. Get on a domestic flight and a mini-tube of paprika flavour Pringles is about as close as you\u2019ll get to an act of self-care. And in a well-equipped motorway services you\u2019ll have the full choice from Burger King to KFC to Costa.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>On a domestic flight, a mini-tube of paprika flavour Pringles is about as close as you\u2019ll get to an act of self-care</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Try to deal with the problem and people will point and laugh. An example: <em>The Kitchen Cabinet</em>, the food panel show I present for Radio 4, generally gets to and from the locations of our early evening live recordings by train. At the end, those of us heading back to London get on board, fully aware that the choice in the buffet car was appalling in the morning and now, gone 8pm, will be a meagre choice of awful.

          "bodyText": "Welcome to gastronomic hell. Or, to be more exact, seat 24, carriage C, on the 11am to Bristol Temple Meads. For it is autumn and I am travelling again, from one end of the United Kingdom to the other. There will be planes, trains and automobiles and while punctuality can\u2019t be guaranteed, one thing is certain: the eating options will be truly awful. We like to think we have gone through a food revolution in this country over the past few decades and in terms of restaurants, and availability of ingredients, we have. But start travelling by public transport or, God help you, pull into a motorway services, and it becomes clear that revolution is still at the Molotov-cocktail-throwing stage. In Bristol or Peckham or Ancoats right now it\u2019s all \u2019nduja and seared hispi cabbage and roasted golden beetroot with whipped feta. Meanwhile, on the 11am to Temple Meads it\u2019s \u201cWould you like to avail yourself of our coffee and Twix deal for \u00a33?\u201d and \u201cJust how bad would you like to feel about yourself today?\u201d The fact is you can have anything you like when you\u2019re on the move in the UK as long as it\u2019s a bolus of oil-drenched carbs. There are sugar-spiked muffins, and dismal croissants so flaccid no form of culinary Viagra would ever get them up again. The buffet car sandwiches taste of profit margin and old age. The \u201chealthy option\u201d on board is a bag of salted peanuts. Get on a domestic flight and a mini-tube of paprika flavour Pringles is about as close as you\u2019ll get to an act of self-care. And in a well-equipped motorway services you\u2019ll have the full choice from Burger King to KFC to Costa. Try to deal with the problem and people will point and laugh. An example: The Kitchen Cabinet, the food panel show I present for Radio 4, generally gets to and from the locations of our early evening live recordings by train. At the end, those of us heading back to London get on board, fully aware that the choice in the buffet car was appalling in the morning and now, gone 8pm, will be a meagre choice of awful. So we have a train picnic purchased in advance: olives and charcuterie, hummus and good cheeses and fresh fruit. One evening I posted a picture of this to Twitter, as we hurtled back from Birmingham or Stoke or Stafford. It was such an extraordinary sight, this train table of nice things to eat, that hundreds of people piled in with their comments.

(I should have made it clear that \u2018y\u2019 is not allowed when used as a vowel, since many of you used a \u2018y\u2019.) I had more than one hundred entries.

Grandma wants Santa\u2019s pants at Xmas as an award All art and rhythm starts at Xmas Bad karma attracts Santa\u2019s cats\u2019 sharp claws! Pack bag, grab map, add a hat - Papa Xmas A bad lad and lass, Adam and pal, saw Santa (anagram Satan) at Xmas and had an asp attack. As mama\u2019s spawn saw straw, a far star had Caspar, Balthazar and pal hatch a gallant plan: a caravan. \u201cAargh! Fat bastard!\u201d bawl brats and charlatans at Xmas bacchanal as adamant phantasmal Lapland handcraftsman (aka Santa) backs karma law (bad = nada) as awards standard. These ones were eliminated because they used a \u2018y\u2019 as a vowel, but I liked them anyway: Xmas: a baby has a grand Dad. ART - RAT - TAR - Abracadabra!! Mark\u2019s anagrams add zap at an Xmas party at Alan\u2019s flat. What can man call a cat at Bahamas at Xmas? Sandy Claws! By a far away track, at dark, Amanda (a nasty pagan) has a dastardly plan, lays a trap and splat, slays Santa! Awkward affray as a gallant Arkansas mall Santa attacks scallywags at salad bar Dad wants an Xmas walk and says \u201cwarm hat and scarf, Jack, and Anna grab that mac! Santa lands, Hangs sacks, Warms hands, Dawn cracks; Lad larks, Lass plays; Dad barks, Nan prays; Cat claws - Balls crash; Fat paws - What a mash; Xmas Day: Dark falls; Away, away - Xmas palls. Dad\u2019s Xmas ham and taramasalata wrap, that ghastly last straw saw Mary snap. Also commended was one reader who sent in this one with only \u2018e\u2019s: The free sherry decrees the red gent be very, extremely, vehemently merry. Now for the proof of the ABCD x 4 = DCBA puzzle: Since the digits in any four digit number describe the thousands, hundreds, tens and units of that number, the four digit numbers in the equation can be rewritten: (1000A + 100B + 10C + D) x 4 = 1000D + 100C + 10 B + A The term to the left of the equals sign must be even, so the term to the right of the equals sign is even, and thus A is even. If A was 3 or bigger, then the number to the left of the equals sign would be bigger than 1000 x 3 x 4 = 12,000, which is forbidden since this would make the number to the right of the equals sign more than four digits. So A = 2. Since A = 2, the left hand side of the equation is at least 8000. So D is either 8 or 9. But if D was 9, then the units digit on the left hand side of the equation would be 6, since 9 x 4 = 36. We know, however, that the units digit must be 2, so we deduce D = 8. Now let\u2019s substitute these two values in the original equation: (2000 + 100B + 40C + 8) x 4 = 8000 + 100C + 10B + 2 Which reduces to 13B + 1 = 2C The only solutions here are B = 1 and C = 7 So the answer is 2178 x 4 = 8712 Thanks to everyone!

          "body": "<p>This year\u2019s hottest and most hunger-stoking food writing has been in vegetarian and vegan books. Food writers have dedicated more time than ever into transforming everyday vegetables into centrepieces for dinner. The one that will undoubtedly get the country cooking more carrots is Jamie Oliver\u2019s first vegetarian book, <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/veg-9780718187767.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">Veg</a> </strong>(Michael Joseph). It strikes just the right balance between old, recognisable dishes such as quiche and moussaka, and new, such as Persian rice and dosas, to keep fancies tickled.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"7b6119e00fbdc96ee1e359de77ebb16acd014066\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b6119e00fbdc96ee1e359de77ebb16acd014066/0_0_1500_2068/725.jpg\" alt=\"Greenfeast: Autumn, Winter Nigel Slater\" width=\"725\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, Nigel Slater\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/greenfeast-9780008213770.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">Greenfeast: Autumn, Winter</a></strong> (4th Estate) is an antidote to every trend-led book. Slater gets that you don\u2019t want to cook all day, that you want something simple for mid-week supper and you\u2019re happy to eat things on toast. While \u201cautumn/winter\u201d is not a radically new idea, it is a testament to how superb a writer he is that this book will make you want to stick a woolly jumper on, go and walk the dog then sit, feet up by the fire with a warm bowl of butternut squash soup.</p> <p>Our worship at the altar of speed and ease in the kitchen shows no sign of abating, given the number of books dedicated to cooking with one pot and/or five to seven ingredients. The shining star is Diana Henry\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/from-the-oven-to-the-table-9781784725846.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">From the Oven to the Table</a></strong> (Mitchell Beazley), in which she faultlessly delivers highly achievable, boldly flavoured dishes. The true genius of this book lies in the fact that they don\u2019t all look as if they have just been \u201cbunged in the oven\u201d when, in effect, they have. Henry also helpfully tells you straight what is too much of a faff and what is worthwhile effort, meaning you\u2019ll never be ambushed mid-recipe, and you\u2019ll learn how to cook along the way.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"eed43ecac8df432ebf4a6bb3a9e22072fa4d1c10\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eed43ecac8df432ebf4a6bb3a9e22072fa4d1c10/0_0_2058_2560/804.jpg\" alt=\"Alison Roman - Nothing Fancy\" width=\"804\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Also on the subject of fuss-free cooking is Alison Roman\u2019s glossy <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/nothing-fancy-9781743795378.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">Nothing Fancy</a> </strong>(Hardie Grant). Roman has an \u201callergy to the word entertaining\u201d but a palpable love for life, having people over and highly flavoured, low-effort food. What\u2019s more, she has a knack for persuading you \u2013 yes, you \u2013 that you can cook a whole fish for friends for dinner and whip up snacks with ease. You won\u2019t find tips on floral arrangements or napkins, but you will find heart, soul and food frequently and unapologetically made using store-cupboard ingredients. If your new year\u2019s resolution is to have people around more often then this is the book for you.</p> <p>The opposite of home cooking is restaurant cooking, and those books rarely make these lists given their propensity to cheffiness (and so a lack of empathy for the home cook). But two have broken ranks this year. The first is Dishoom\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/dishoom-9781408890677.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">From Bombay with Love</a></strong> (Bloomsbury), a lovingly put-together guide that is packed full of stories and beautiful photos. It shares the secrets (at long last) of the restaurant group\u2019s popular recipes, from their bacon naan roll to their chicken Ruby Murray and Black Dal. A book for both the coffee table and the kitchen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3973a0bdfc1bed60f35e95c73db4c8d702d523bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3973a0bdfc1bed60f35e95c73db4c8d702d523bd/0_46_3479_3478/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dishoom\u2019s house black dal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At long last, the secret is out ... Dishoom\u2019s Black Dal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ola O Smit/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The second restaurant title (and possibly my favourite book on this list) is <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/black-axe-mangal-9780714879314.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">Black Axe Mangal</a> </strong>(Phaidon) by Lee Tiernan, a chef-disciple of the Fergus Henderson, nose-to-tail school. It roars with audacious personality, colour and flavour. But there\u2019s substance to back it up, with generous information on grilling, smoking \u2013 hot-boxing your own mackerel, for example, or de-boning a hare. OK, so some recipes are completely unachievable, but others like aubergine and ricotta flatbread might make it to your dinner table. Not for the novice cook or the faint-hearted \u2013 but it is really great.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"6f35986ff929e68dd4d6664aff8e6d019e6ad00c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f35986ff929e68dd4d6664aff8e6d019e6ad00c/0_0_1815_2560/709.jpg\" alt=\"The Island Kitchen by Selina Periampillai\" width=\"709\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This year there has been a welcome selection of books on food from all over the world. The one most plastered with my sticky notes is Selina Periampillai\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-island-kitchen-9781526601384.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">The Island Kitchen</a></strong> (Bloomsbury) with recipes from the Indian Ocean islands, from Madagascar to Mauritius (where the author\u2019s parents are from) and the Maldives. For the most part the story of the food is the story of people who migrated to the islands from Europe, Asia and Africa, resulting in vibrant and invigorating flavours. King prawns with tamarind and coconut, Creole saffran (spicy turmeric) rice, and cumin and lentil flatbreads are all on my to-cook list.</p> <p>Fuchsia Dunlop\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-food-of-sichuan-9781408867556.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">The Food of Sichuan</a></strong> (Bloomsbury) was first published almost 20 years ago and became something of a bible, but has been updated with new information, recipes and beautiful photos.

          "bodyText": "This year\u2019s hottest and most hunger-stoking food writing has been in vegetarian and vegan books. Food writers have dedicated more time than ever into transforming everyday vegetables into centrepieces for dinner. The one that will undoubtedly get the country cooking more carrots is Jamie Oliver\u2019s first vegetarian book, Veg (Michael Joseph). It strikes just the right balance between old, recognisable dishes such as quiche and moussaka, and new, such as Persian rice and dosas, to keep fancies tickled. Meanwhile, Nigel Slater\u2019s Greenfeast: Autumn, Winter (4th Estate) is an antidote to every trend-led book. Slater gets that you don\u2019t want to cook all day, that you want something simple for mid-week supper and you\u2019re happy to eat things on toast. While \u201cautumn/winter\u201d is not a radically new idea, it is a testament to how superb a writer he is that this book will make you want to stick a woolly jumper on, go and walk the dog then sit, feet up by the fire with a warm bowl of butternut squash soup. Our worship at the altar of speed and ease in the kitchen shows no sign of abating, given the number of books dedicated to cooking with one pot and/or five to seven ingredients. The shining star is Diana Henry\u2019s From the Oven to the Table (Mitchell Beazley), in which she faultlessly delivers highly achievable, boldly flavoured dishes. The true genius of this book lies in the fact that they don\u2019t all look as if they have just been \u201cbunged in the oven\u201d when, in effect, they have. Henry also helpfully tells you straight what is too much of a faff and what is worthwhile effort, meaning you\u2019ll never be ambushed mid-recipe, and you\u2019ll learn how to cook along the way. Also on the subject of fuss-free cooking is Alison Roman\u2019s glossy Nothing Fancy (Hardie Grant). Roman has an \u201callergy to the word entertaining\u201d but a palpable love for life, having people over and highly flavoured, low-effort food. What\u2019s more, she has a knack for persuading you \u2013 yes, you \u2013 that you can cook a whole fish for friends for dinner and whip up snacks with ease. You won\u2019t find tips on floral arrangements or napkins, but you will find heart, soul and food frequently and unapologetically made using store-cupboard ingredients. If your new year\u2019s resolution is to have people around more often then this is the book for you. The opposite of home cooking is restaurant cooking, and those books rarely make these lists given their propensity to cheffiness (and so a lack of empathy for the home cook). But two have broken ranks this year. The first is Dishoom\u2019s From Bombay with Love (Bloomsbury), a lovingly put-together guide that is packed full of stories and beautiful photos. It shares the secrets (at long last) of the restaurant group\u2019s popular recipes, from their bacon naan roll to their chicken Ruby Murray and Black Dal. A book for both the coffee table and the kitchen. The second restaurant title (and possibly my favourite book on this list) is Black Axe Mangal (Phaidon) by Lee Tiernan, a chef-disciple of the Fergus Henderson, nose-to-tail school. It roars with audacious personality, colour and flavour. But there\u2019s substance to back it up, with generous information on grilling, smoking \u2013 hot-boxing your own mackerel, for example, or de-boning a hare. OK, so some recipes are completely unachievable, but others like aubergine and ricotta flatbread might make it to your dinner table. Not for the novice cook or the faint-hearted \u2013 but it is really great. This year there has been a welcome selection of books on food from all over the world. The one most plastered with my sticky notes is Selina Periampillai\u2019s The Island Kitchen (Bloomsbury) with recipes from the Indian Ocean islands, from Madagascar to Mauritius (where the author\u2019s parents are from) and the Maldives. For the most part the story of the food is the story of people who migrated to the islands from Europe, Asia and Africa, resulting in vibrant and invigorating flavours. King prawns with tamarind and coconut, Creole saffran (spicy turmeric) rice, and cumin and lentil flatbreads are all on my to-cook list. Fuchsia Dunlop\u2019s The Food of Sichuan (Bloomsbury) was first published almost 20 years ago and became something of a bible, but has been updated with new information, recipes and beautiful photos. Now it is a masterpiece. There is much expert knowledge and brilliant writing from Dunlop on textures, techniques and the story of Sichuanese cuisine. Equally, there are many achievable recipes, from bang-bang chicken to dandan noodles, which beg you to drop by your local Chinese grocer and get straight into the kitchen. Georgie Hayden\u2019s Taverna (Square Peg) takes her back to Cyprus, her motherland, for recipes her yia-yias (grandmothers) would be proud of. Much of this food I\u2019ve heard of \u2013 halva, taramasalata \u2013 but much of it I haven\u2019t, and tomato-braised peas and beans, courgette keftedes, tahinopita (tahini and cinnamon swirl) all sound delicious. The recipes centre on feasting, family and community, and the stories and photographs of her family are more personal, combining to give a satisfying taste of home. More homely cooking is available in Vicky Bennison\u2019s Pasta Grannies (Hardie Grant), the book of the YouTube series in which Italian nonnas show you how to make pasta dishes by hand. Part anthropological record of a dying skill, part deep dive into Italy\u2019s incredible regional culinary repertoire, it is a heart-warming big hug of a book. Baking books have tailed off in tandem with Bake Off viewer figures and instead fermented foods, pickles and preserves have arrived. Sour (Quadrille) by Mark Diacono zings from page to page, with must-cook-now recipes using the tang of citrus or the sweet sour of tamarind. Away from the direct heat of the stove, Bee Wilson\u2019s excellent The Way We Eat Now (4th Estate) is a state-of-the-nation book that explores our food systems, how global economics has changed the way we eat and how what we eat is not necessarily a question of personal choice. However, the book I\u2019ll be curling up with when not actually cooking is Charlotte Druckman\u2019s Women on Food (Abrams), her wide-ranging, unorthodox anthology of food writing. It\u2019s sharp, witty, entertaining and has insights from a host of brilliant food writers, from Nigella to Tejal Rao. \u2022 Meera Sodha\u2019s East: 120 Vegetarian and Vegan recipes from Bangalore to Beijing is published by Fig Tree. \u2022 Save up to 30% on the books of the year at guardianbookshop.com",

          "bodyText": "One of the perils of living in a seaside resort such as Deal on the east coast of Kent is that, eventually, London will find you. One minute, you can pop out to Londis in your dressing gown, drink Gold Blend and have no real opinion on nuno felting, then a shift will occur. One of those incomers will paint over a pebble-dashed terrace with Farrow &amp; Ball Arsenic, open a gluten-free macaron kiosk, and the game will be up. For Kensal Rise and Hackney people, that\u2019s like leaving jam out for ants. Soon, you\u2019ll be knee deep in nocellara olives, spoken-word performances and places like The Rose on Deal high street, a recently tarted-up pub, restaurant and boutique hotel. Any implication that the plutonium-grade revampment of The Rose from rough-and-ready, 200-year-old, old-school boozer to chic magnet for mini-breakers is \u201can improvement\u201d will doubtless cause the locals umbrage. Nevertheless, it now serves rhubarb mezcal cocktails, tiny bowls of Marcona almonds, wild nettle soup and ox tongue on beetroot. For \u00a3200, without dinner, I stayed one Friday night in a bric-a-brac-stuffed room painted in jarring shades of burgundy, turquoise and navy, with a velour curtain in place of a toilet door and a communal Nespresso machine in the corridor.

Yet, all across Milos, are characterful, family-run restaurants just like it, which aren\u2019t merely \u201cworking the season\u201d but proudly practising slow cooking and inventive locavore menus.

And it\u2019s also supplanting this modest volcanic island\u2019s main claim to fame \u2013 as the birthplace of the Aphrodite of Milos (Venus de Milo). As local restaurants acquire more international dash, sophisticated Athenians make a point of going each year to relish food now on a par with the capital (and the island has some of Greece\u2019s most dramatic beaches, too).</p> <p>\u201cTwenty, even ten, years ago Milos was a very \u2018Greek\u2019 island of fishermen and miners; it was never geared to tourism,\u201d says Gina. \u201cBut over the past five years restaurants have become more gourmet, without losing their core charms.\u201d</p> <p>In the three days I spent speed-dating the island\u2019s culinary scene, I found creative, assured and gimmick-free Mediterranean menus and, underpinning it all, was the pleasing democracy that defines Greek cuisine. Even at Milos\u2019s priciest restaurants, you can eat to a budget and there will be no judgment for forsaking bottled wine and fish priced by the kilo in preference for meze, pitta dipped into creamy taramasalata, and house plonk by the jug.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ea520d88fae7ef615f07217debc5a29dcceb9d86\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea520d88fae7ef615f07217debc5a29dcceb9d86/0_0_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Snorkellers at Kleftiko caves, Milos, Greece.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Snorkellers at Kleftiko caves.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stuart Black/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Culinary kudos aside, horseshoe-shaped Milos is also a show-stopper because of its spectacular geological and rock formations.

          "bodyText": "The word-of-mouth buzz about O Hamos, a family-run taverna on the Greek island of Milos, had been so loud that I\u2019d heard it in Athens. So I decided to discover it, over a late lunch, for myself. Now, it may be a surprise that there is no seafood on the menu \u2013 given the restaurant\u2019s fantastic location near the sea \u2013 but if the Psatha family can\u2019t grow it, breed it or produce it on their farm, it\u2019s got no business being on their hand-thrown plates. Plus, as well as supplying all the taverna\u2019s meat and vegetables, they also make their own cheeses. No matter, I was under orders from foodie friends in Athens to look no further than the katsikaki (young goat) baked in parchment with molasses. We threw in a \u201chalf-kilo\u201d of local white wine (that\u2019s how we order it in Greece) with a few traditional dishes, such as bouyiourdi (tomatoes, feta cheese and spicy peppers baked in a clay pot) and mopped up every bite with homemade bread that hung from our chairs in string bags. Tables filled up fast across the courtyard, a Greek version of an English pub garden with bright geraniums, terracotta pots and kitchen herbs that spilled out of driftwood planters. \u201cForget trying to land a table here after 7pm,\u201d said Gina, my lunch date (who summered on Milos as a child before moving here five years ago). When our bill came, it was barely more than \u20ac10 each, and we also received a visit from Athina, the Psatha family matriarch, who brought us a free round of tsipouro. She also arrived with a black marker and invited me to scrawl over her pale lemon walls: a house ritual \u2013 the buzzy courtyard is full of poetic inscriptions and odes to Athina\u2019s cooking. O Hamos is near the port town of Adamas and has been open for 27 years. Yet, all across Milos, are characterful, family-run restaurants just like it, which aren\u2019t merely \u201cworking the season\u201d but proudly practising slow cooking and inventive locavore menus. Not because it\u2019s trending but because it\u2019s how they\u2019ve always done it. Often, the culinary spotlight has been on Sifnos, Milos\u2019s stylish Cycladic neighbour, but now word has got out that the cuisine here is just as good. And it\u2019s also supplanting this modest volcanic island\u2019s main claim to fame \u2013 as the birthplace of the Aphrodite of Milos (Venus de Milo). As local restaurants acquire more international dash, sophisticated Athenians make a point of going each year to relish food now on a par with the capital (and the island has some of Greece\u2019s most dramatic beaches, too). \u201cTwenty, even ten, years ago Milos was a very \u2018Greek\u2019 island of fishermen and miners; it was never geared to tourism,\u201d says Gina. \u201cBut over the past five years restaurants have become more gourmet, without losing their core charms.\u201d In the three days I spent speed-dating the island\u2019s culinary scene, I found creative, assured and gimmick-free Mediterranean menus and, underpinning it all, was the pleasing democracy that defines Greek cuisine. Even at Milos\u2019s priciest restaurants, you can eat to a budget and there will be no judgment for forsaking bottled wine and fish priced by the kilo in preference for meze, pitta dipped into creamy taramasalata, and house plonk by the jug. Culinary kudos aside, horseshoe-shaped Milos is also a show-stopper because of its spectacular geological and rock formations. You might even take time to marvel at the lunar-like beauty of Sarakiniko beach, explore some of the 70-plus other sandy beaches, or swim amid the caves at Kleftiko in waters so blue you\u2019d believe Photoshop has been used. \u2022 ohamos-milos.gr More Milos: six food experiences Volcanic food at Sirocco This family-run beach taverna in Paleochori does simple Greek food, slow-cooked for hours in a volcanic sand pit. Food is buried in clay pots 40cm beneath the surface, where it\u2019s heated by geothermal springs. \u201cMy father started experimenting 20 years ago,\u201d says owner Stella Tseroni. \u201cHe began with an egg and a potato, then graduated to meat.\u201d Stella\u2019s son invites diners onto the sand to watch him dig up their lunch, which can include lamb shank (\u20ac13 for a plate two can share), roast potatoes, and a whole aubergine (\u20ac5 each). Paleochori isn\u2019t the prettiest beach on Milos but the food really satisfies. \u2022 restaurantsirocco.gr Seafood to savour at Armira The bijou port of Pollonia is great for seafood, with terrific fish restaurants dotted around it. Classy Armira \u2013 with its standout dishes of stonefish soup and shrimp ragout inside a Cypriot pie with yoghurt sauce \u2013 stole the show last summer by adding a roof garden to its chic whitewashed courtyard. All the fish on the menu comes from the family\u2019s traditional kaiki fishing boat and you can eat and drink fantastically well here from around \u20ac15 a head \u2013 a favourite is the octopus with fava (yellow split peas cooked with onions and garlic). \u2022 On Facebook Meze at Medusa With a cliffside setting above the brightly painted syrmata (fishermen\u2019s huts) of Mandrakia village, Medusa ouzerie is a much-loved spot for a lingering lunch. Enjoy ouzo the Greek way: teamed with seafood meze, sunshine and a sea breeze. The grilled sardines, smoked eel with fava (both around \u20ac9), and the aubergine and courgette balls (\u20ac5) are all great choices. Wander down to the fishing village of Firopatamos below for a post-prandial nap on one of the beanbags that front the iridescent waters. \u2022 medusamilos.gr Beach picnic from Kivotos ton Gefseon, Firiplaka In Pollonia, visit Kivotos ton Gefseon (Ark of Flavours) and grab a few slices of its must-try watermelon pie \u2013 watermelon, honey, cinnamon, flour, sesame, and oven baked \u2013 for \u20ac2.50 a portion, or try the galaktoboureko (\u20ac3.80). The latter is Greece\u2019s answer to the custard slice. Batches come out of the oven every half hour, so wait with a coffee or a dish of its homemade yoghurt with fruit and honey (\u20ac3.80) in the rose garden or browse the honeys and oils made by this family of beekeepers. Take away your goodies and picnic on Firiplaka Bay: a volcanic beach set against pink-and-white cliffs. The adventurous may prefer Tsigrado, the smaller, more secluded beach next door, reached by a short climb down a steep rope ladder. Sunset dining in Tripiti Slip away from the tourists who flock to the historic hilltop town of Plaka to salute the sunset and go to the next village down, Tripiti, instead.

Brunch at Astakas in Klyma White tables metres from the water; sea spray around your ankles; colourful fisherman\u2019s cottages as a backdrop \u2013 this merely whets the appetite here.

Tasting menu \u00a365. Wines from \u00a323</strong></p> <p>A brutally cold winter\u2019s day in Harrogate or, as it\u2019s known in Yorkshire at this time of year, a Friday. My train has been delayed. We have called ahead to explain why we will be 30 minutes late but no matter, we are here now. We are ready for lunch. The question is, when will it begin? And will I ever thaw out?</p> <p>I look around the brightly lit dining room of <a href=\"https://www.restaurant92.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Restaurant 92</a> and spot a couple of electric heaters pointed at two of the three occupied tables, their LEDs flashing prettily. Ours is not one of the tables to be so blessed. We are cold and we are hungry. For a long while, it appears we will stay that way. I ask politely whether we might get some bread, just to see us through the wait for the starters. The waiter tells us, equally politely, that there will be bread. He says it in a manner that indicates they have a plan which they are sticking to.</p> <p>All anybody wants to know when they enter a restaurant is that, in return for their money, everything will be OK. We want to know this very quickly. But quick, along with warm, does not appear to be on the agenda today. It takes 20 minutes from our arrival for that bread to turn up and another 15 after that to see the canap\u00e9s. These are long waits in a chilly room. Did I mention the temperature?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"78a848dcac84993ee8166a9443b8a96ae647e005\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78a848dcac84993ee8166a9443b8a96ae647e005/0_138_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018A plate of food you can explore\u2019: rabbit and carrots.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A plate of food you can explore\u2019: rabbit and carrots.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Martin/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For now, I will stop being distracted by these things, at least here in print if not back there in the room. Head chef <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jul/05/fast-food-recipe-burrata\" title=\"\">Michael Carr</a> is a talented cook. He is only 24, but has already worked in some serious kitchens. He does not prioritise prissy visuals over flavour, and he has some fun ideas. There is a largesse and enthusiasm to his food. He takes admirable risks. The problem is that he\u2019s charging \u00a355 for three courses, which is a slab of anybody\u2019s money, especially in a room like this where the big light is on and the radiators are off. It does not leave space for mistakes. Three courses at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2018/nov/11/roski-liverpool-use-any-excuse-to-eat-here-restaurant-review\" title=\"\">R\u00f6ski</a> in Liverpool a few weeks ago was \u00a345. That was faultless. This really isn\u2019t.</p> <p>The issue is unevenness. Here, the bread is to be taken seriously. It isn\u2019t just something to get you through. It is a moment. It must be explained, which it is, in detail. On one side of the platter is a \u201cchicken fat\u201d brioche with a scoop of whipped butter, flavoured with beef dripping and dusted with onion powder. It\u2019s animal fat-tastic. If you like your bread to have once had legs, feathers, fur and a pulse, it\u2019s the bread course for you. It is luscious: there\u2019s a light buttery brioche and a whipped butter that could be used as a seasoning or, alternatively, a massage oil.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Yorkshire rabbit and carrots is Carr\u2019s cooking at its prettiest best, whimsical but unembarrassed about huge flavours</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But then there\u2019s the other side of the plate that carries triangular crackers crusted with rosemary and a ramekin of taramasalata to dredge them through. It\u2019s all wrongness. The tarama is so acidic it tastes like tomato ketchup, and the cracker doesn\u2019t. It bends. There are similar issues with canap\u00e9s. Truffled arancini are delightful, comforting spheres of waft and soothe and loveliness. Then there\u2019s the \u201ccrispy, salt and vinegar lamb skin\u201d. Again, I love the idea. Why should pork get all the scratching action? Lamb fat can get in on the act, too. But it has to be served damn hot and damn crisp. This isn\u2019t. You can taste the overly long wait it had on the pass. It was great, but perhaps 10 minutes ago.</p> <p>Eventually, 45 minutes after our arrival, we get to the starters. A platter of Yorkshire rabbit and carrots is Carr\u2019s cooking at its prettiest and best. It\u2019s whimsical, but also unembarrassed about huge flavours. There is shredded confited leg between discs of purple carrot. There\u2019s a teeny-weeny rabbit rack, a cylinder of loin, dollops of acidulated carrot pur\u00e9e and what is announced as a \u201cKFC lamb sweetbread\u201d which does indeed come in the crispiest of coatings. It\u2019s a plate of food you can explore.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c1b2e5f60a92954186da1bc33e91c2bd48af0f3a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1b2e5f60a92954186da1bc33e91c2bd48af0f3a/683_605_2511_1507/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Bold and dramatic\u2019: scallops and chicken wings.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Bold and dramatic\u2019: scallops and chicken wings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Martin/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In another starter, fat scallops from Orkney are joined by a wedge of charred and buttery pumpkin, crunchy pieces of boned chicken wing and a transparent glass-like crisp flavoured with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2015/jun/30/i-ate-sriracha-hot-sauce-on-everything-for-an-entire-day\" title=\"\">sriracha</a> sauce. It is a bold and dramatic dish and would be thrilling, were it not for the extra 45 seconds the scallops have spent in the hot pan. There is a similar problem with a turbot dish. Admirably, the fish has been cooked on the bone. Unfortunately, it\u2019s also just overcooked which is a crying shame for such a fine piece of fish. But again, there are elements on this plate to wallow in: a cep pur\u00e9e with the lightest dice of tomato, and sweet salty clams alongside braised cabbage leaves. Perched on top of those leaves are bright yellow balls of saffron potato. They are completely undercooked. They slide away from my fork.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>\u2018Scallops from Orkney with sriracha sauce would be thrilling, were it not for the extra 45 seconds spent in the hot pan\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>More consistent is a piece of crisp-skinned roasted guinea fowl, with fronds of roasted mushroom, a paunchy truffled potato terrine and pieces of charred sweetcorn, over which is poured a meaty, creamy old-school sauce, the good kind of brown. It could have done without the granola. I understand the desire to provide texture, but sweetened breakfast cereal is not the way to go. I do however acknowledge that a dislike of granola on savoury dishes is a long-held prejudice of mine. Others might approve. They\u2019d be wrong, but they might.</p> <p>Desserts feel like initial sketches, in need of further thought. In the case of something called \u201cFallen Autumnal Leaves\u201d, modelled on the forest floor, the main thought should be that it\u2019s a terrible idea. Jerusalem artichoke sponge cake is a promise, completely broken. Tuber does not bellow dessert at me. Caramelised and salted pieces of artichoke don\u2019t improve things. A plate of British cherries with fragments of frangipane and candyfloss is much better, though a thin disc of crumbly, cherry jelly wouldn\u2019t be missed if it was mislaid.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c15de6ce102ec866e93a84f7989e315482f4c55a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c15de6ce102ec866e93a84f7989e315482f4c55a/65_183_3875_2325/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018In need of further thought\u2019: \u2018Fallen Autumnal Leaves\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018In need of further thought\u2019: \u2018Fallen Autumnal Leaves\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Martin/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To get warm we order coffee. We begin one of those cheery \u201cwe\u2019re all in it together\u201d conversations about the chill, with the other tables.

          "bodyText": "Restaurant 92, 92 Station Parade, Harrogate HG1 1HQ (01423 503 027). A la carte (three courses) \u00a355. Limited lunch menu (three courses) \u00a324. Tasting menu \u00a365. Wines from \u00a323 A brutally cold winter\u2019s day in Harrogate or, as it\u2019s known in Yorkshire at this time of year, a Friday. My train has been delayed. We have called ahead to explain why we will be 30 minutes late but no matter, we are here now. We are ready for lunch. The question is, when will it begin? And will I ever thaw out? I look around the brightly lit dining room of Restaurant 92 and spot a couple of electric heaters pointed at two of the three occupied tables, their LEDs flashing prettily. Ours is not one of the tables to be so blessed. We are cold and we are hungry. For a long while, it appears we will stay that way. I ask politely whether we might get some bread, just to see us through the wait for the starters. The waiter tells us, equally politely, that there will be bread. He says it in a manner that indicates they have a plan which they are sticking to. All anybody wants to know when they enter a restaurant is that, in return for their money, everything will be OK. We want to know this very quickly. But quick, along with warm, does not appear to be on the agenda today. It takes 20 minutes from our arrival for that bread to turn up and another 15 after that to see the canap\u00e9s. These are long waits in a chilly room. Did I mention the temperature? For now, I will stop being distracted by these things, at least here in print if not back there in the room. Head chef Michael Carr is a talented cook. He is only 24, but has already worked in some serious kitchens. He does not prioritise prissy visuals over flavour, and he has some fun ideas. There is a largesse and enthusiasm to his food. He takes admirable risks. The problem is that he\u2019s charging \u00a355 for three courses, which is a slab of anybody\u2019s money, especially in a room like this where the big light is on and the radiators are off. It does not leave space for mistakes. Three courses at R\u00f6ski in Liverpool a few weeks ago was \u00a345. That was faultless. This really isn\u2019t. The issue is unevenness. Here, the bread is to be taken seriously. It isn\u2019t just something to get you through. It is a moment. It must be explained, which it is, in detail. On one side of the platter is a \u201cchicken fat\u201d brioche with a scoop of whipped butter, flavoured with beef dripping and dusted with onion powder. It\u2019s animal fat-tastic. If you like your bread to have once had legs, feathers, fur and a pulse, it\u2019s the bread course for you. It is luscious: there\u2019s a light buttery brioche and a whipped butter that could be used as a seasoning or, alternatively, a massage oil. But then there\u2019s the other side of the plate that carries triangular crackers crusted with rosemary and a ramekin of taramasalata to dredge them through. It\u2019s all wrongness. The tarama is so acidic it tastes like tomato ketchup, and the cracker doesn\u2019t. It bends. There are similar issues with canap\u00e9s. Truffled arancini are delightful, comforting spheres of waft and soothe and loveliness. Then there\u2019s the \u201ccrispy, salt and vinegar lamb skin\u201d. Again, I love the idea. Why should pork get all the scratching action? Lamb fat can get in on the act, too. But it has to be served damn hot and damn crisp. This isn\u2019t. You can taste the overly long wait it had on the pass. It was great, but perhaps 10 minutes ago. Eventually, 45 minutes after our arrival, we get to the starters. A platter of Yorkshire rabbit and carrots is Carr\u2019s cooking at its prettiest and best. It\u2019s whimsical, but also unembarrassed about huge flavours. There is shredded confited leg between discs of purple carrot. There\u2019s a teeny-weeny rabbit rack, a cylinder of loin, dollops of acidulated carrot pur\u00e9e and what is announced as a \u201cKFC lamb sweetbread\u201d which does indeed come in the crispiest of coatings. It\u2019s a plate of food you can explore. In another starter, fat scallops from Orkney are joined by a wedge of charred and buttery pumpkin, crunchy pieces of boned chicken wing and a transparent glass-like crisp flavoured with sriracha sauce. It is a bold and dramatic dish and would be thrilling, were it not for the extra 45 seconds the scallops have spent in the hot pan. There is a similar problem with a turbot dish. Admirably, the fish has been cooked on the bone. Unfortunately, it\u2019s also just overcooked which is a crying shame for such a fine piece of fish. But again, there are elements on this plate to wallow in: a cep pur\u00e9e with the lightest dice of tomato, and sweet salty clams alongside braised cabbage leaves. Perched on top of those leaves are bright yellow balls of saffron potato. They are completely undercooked. They slide away from my fork. More consistent is a piece of crisp-skinned roasted guinea fowl, with fronds of roasted mushroom, a paunchy truffled potato terrine and pieces of charred sweetcorn, over which is poured a meaty, creamy old-school sauce, the good kind of brown. It could have done without the granola. I understand the desire to provide texture, but sweetened breakfast cereal is not the way to go. I do however acknowledge that a dislike of granola on savoury dishes is a long-held prejudice of mine. Others might approve. They\u2019d be wrong, but they might. Desserts feel like initial sketches, in need of further thought. In the case of something called \u201cFallen Autumnal Leaves\u201d, modelled on the forest floor, the main thought should be that it\u2019s a terrible idea. Jerusalem artichoke sponge cake is a promise, completely broken. Tuber does not bellow dessert at me. Caramelised and salted pieces of artichoke don\u2019t improve things. A plate of British cherries with fragments of frangipane and candyfloss is much better, though a thin disc of crumbly, cherry jelly wouldn\u2019t be missed if it was mislaid. To get warm we order coffee. We begin one of those cheery \u201cwe\u2019re all in it together\u201d conversations about the chill, with the other tables. I tell them I have heater envy, one of Freud\u2019s lesser known diagnoses. Finally, the otherwise efficient waiters acknowledge there might be a temperature issue. Mostly, there is the feeling here of an ambitious restaurant which could be great, but which right now isn\u2019t quite sure how to become so. I do hope they work it out.
