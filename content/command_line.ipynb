    "We have now covered all the basics of working with Python: the use of [variables](extras/glossary.md#variable), different [data types](extras/glossary.md#type), various [control statements](extras/glossary.md#control), [exceptions](extras/glossary.md#exception), [functions](extras/glossary.md#function), and the organization of programs as [modules](extras/glossary.md#module). There are still a great many important features of Python to learn, but with what we have covered so far it is already possible to write useful programs. Over the next few lessons we will mostly take a break from Python itself to focus on a few important aspects of software development: the process of building a working computer program.\n",
    "\n",
    "While learning about software development, we will on a few occasions need to step outside Python and give commands to our computer's operating system more directly. All the major [operating systems](extras/glossary.md#OS) provide a means to accomplish basic tasks by typing in commands instead of clicking on icons or menu options. This is the way that operating systems used to work before they evolved graphical interfaces. The place where we can type in commands for the operating system is variously called the 'command line', 'command prompt', 'console', or 'terminal' (though for die-hard pedants there are subtle differences between some of these terms).\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps needed to find the command line differ slightly across different [operating systems](extras/glossary.md#OS). On Linux and macOS, an application called the 'Terminal' provides a command line. It looks like this:\n",

    "![](images/terminal.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "On Windows, a similar-looking application called the 'Command prompt' serves the same function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, different operating systems understand different commands. Windows in particular differs from the others. So in order to ensure that what we learn will work for all of us, we will limit our use of the command line just to what is necessary for the techniques we need to learn, and we will use the command line in a way that is compatible with all the major operating systems.\n",
