    "# The command line\n",
    "\n",
    "We have now covered all the basics of working with Python: the use of [variables](extras/glossary.md#variable), different [data types](extras/glossary.md#type), various [control statements](extras/glossary.md#control), [exceptions](extras/glossary.md#exception), [functions](extras/glossary.md#function), and the organization of programs as [modules](extras/glossary.md#module). There are still a great many important features of Python to learn, but with what we have covered so far it is already possible to write useful programs. Over the next few lessons we will mostly take a break from Python itself to focus on a few important aspects of software development: the process of building a working computer program.\n",
    "\n",
    "While learning about software development, we will on a few occasions need to step outside Python and give commands to our computer's operating system more directly. All the major [operating systems](extras/glossary.md#OS) provide a means to accomplish basic tasks by typing in commands instead of clicking on icons or menu options. This is the way that operating systems used to work before they evolved graphical interfaces. The place where we can type in commands for the operating system is variously called the 'command line', 'command prompt', 'console', or 'terminal' (though for die-hard pedants some of these terms refer to subtly different aspects of interaction with the operating system).\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps needed to find the command line differ slightly across different operating systems. On Linux and macOS, an application called the 'Terminal' provides a command line. It looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/terminal.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "On Windows, a similar-looking application called the 'Command prompt' serves the same function. Alternatively, if you have installed Anaconda as recommended for the class, you can access the command line via an app called 'Anaconda Prompt'. The [online documentation](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/#open-anaconda-prompt) for Anaconda provides a few more details about this app.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, different operating systems understand different commands. Windows in particular differs from the others. So in order to ensure that the demonstrations work for all of us, we will limit our use of the command line just to what is necessary for the techniques we need to learn, and we will use the command line in a way that is compatible with all the major operating systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic commands\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at a very few of the most basic commands that we can use in the command line. All of these are compatible with the major operating systems. If you would like to try them out, open up your command line app as described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "### cd\n",
    "\n",
    "To interact with Python files from the command line, we will need to make sure that we are working in the [directory](extras/glossary.md#directory) that contains those files. This is the same principle that we encountered when [working with files and folders](standard_library.ipynb#Working-directory) in a Python program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, the command line itself will display the [path](extras/glossary.md#path) to whatever directory you are currently working in. For example, in the screenshot above, the relative path from my home folder to the current directory is shown as `/GitHub/introduction-to-programming` (with the forward slash `/` as the path [separator](extras/glossary.md#separator)).\n",
    "\n",
    "To switch to a subdirectory of the current one, enter the command `cd` (which stands for **c**hange **d**irectory), followed by the name of the directory you want to switch into. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/cd.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "To move 'up' one directory in your computer's file system, use `cd` followed by `..` (in file systems, `..` stands for 'the directory that contains the current one'). For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/cd_dot_dot.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### dir\n",
    "\n",
    "To see the contents of the current directory, use the command `dir`. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/dir.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### python\n",
    "\n",
    "If Python is installed on your operating system, you can run Python programs from the command line as well as from Spyder. To do this, simply type `python`, followed by the name of the Python program that you want to run. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/command_line.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that you first need to make sure that you are working inside the directory that contains the Python file that you would like to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beware that if you just type `python`, without specifying a file to run, then you will open a Python console. You can then type in Python commands and see them run immediately, much the same as in the Spyder console. But this is a rather laborious way of interacting with Python, and we won't use it. If you start up Python this way by accident and need to return to the normal command line, use the Python `exit()` function. Like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/exit.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Spyder\n",
    "\n",
    "The Spyder console provides a means of sending commands to the operating system. This is quicker and simpler than finding your command line app and then using `cd` to navigate to the directory that you want to work in. If you can make the following example work from Spyder, I recommend using this method of interacting with the command line, as it will save you switching between two different windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Spyder console, if you place an exclamation mark character (`!`) at the beginning of a command, Spyder will send that command to the operating system's command line, and not to Python. Here is an example:"
