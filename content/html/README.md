# html pages

This directory contains the topic notes as html files. These are usually easier to view 'offline' if you have downloaded the course content and would like to browse it on your own computer instead of on the GitHub site. You can also download only the html files in the compressed file [intro_prog_html.zip](intro_prog_html.zip).
