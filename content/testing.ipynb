    "# Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "As you have probably noticed by now, it is easy to make mistakes when writing a computer program. Computers cannot easily guess what it is that we want of them, nor do they have any idea of what sort of things it is reasonable to want to do. So we must give a computer precise, [syntactically correct](extras/glossary.md#syntax) instructions that represent exactly what we want to do, and if we get this wrong, the computer will either be unable to do as we asked, in which case our program will break off with an [error](extras/glossary.md#error), or it will happily carry out the instructions we gave it, even when these are not actually the instructions that we wanted to give, and even if we have mistakenly instructed it to do something stupid or malicious such as emailing the contents of our downloads folder to our boss. It is therefore important to check our programs carefully for mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Up until now, we have been able to check a program fairly easily by simply running it, if it is just a [script](extras/glossary.md#script), or importing it and then using its functions in the console if it is a [module](extras/glossary.md#module). But this sort of informal testing can only take us so far. Once we start writing programs that may take multiple different actions depending on user input, subtle mistakes may be difficult to detect in a quick informal test, because they only arise for some inputs and not others. For these reasons, most software developers test their programs systematically as they go along. Instead of testing a program manually, they write a second program whose only purpose is to test the main program. This test program tries out the main program with different inputs, and verifies that its behavior is as expected. In other words, a test program automates the process of testing the main program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing test programs can be tedious. As if we didn't already have enough work to do writing the main program, we now have to write another one that won't even be part of the finished product. It is tempting to dispense with testing, especially if a project is small. But we should not. Good tests act as a reasonable guarantee that our program functions correctly. And as the saying goes: Most customers prefer a product that actually works.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example program\n",
    "\n",
    "In the spirit of the class so far, we won't actually be developing a product that any healthy customer would want to download. Instead, we have a program for producing [spoonerisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoonerism). A spoonerism is a play on words in which the initial consonants (or groups of consonants) of two words are swapped. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* crushing blow → blushing crow\n",
    "* cosy nook → nosy cook\n",
    "* wasted term → tasted werm\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this lesson is about testing, we will look at the finished example program already. Our task will be to write some tests for the program. Let's import the program as [module](extras/glossary.md#module) and make some informal tests first. (If you need to refresh your understanding of modules and imports, take a look back at the [lesson on modules](modules.ipynb).)"

This is something that we learned about in the [lesson on modules](modules.ipynb#__name__). This sort of 'built-in test' can take us quite far, and is especially helpful early on in the development of a program.

Among the first things that the test program should do is import the module to be tested, since it will need to [call](extras/glossary.md#call) that module's functions and check their results. After importing the module to be tested, the test program defines functions, each of which tests one aspect of the module.\n",

    "Test functions look a little different from the functions we have written so far. They do not have any [return value](extras/glossary.md#return), and in most cases they have no input [arguments](extras/glossary.md#argument) either.

    "What is an assertion? An assertion is yet another kind of [control statement](extras/glossary.md#control). You can think of it as a special kind of [condition](extras/glossary.md#condition), like in an `if` statement. Similar to an `if` statement, an assertion checks whether a particular condition is true or false, for example checking whether two things are equal using `==`. But unlike an `if` statement, we do not specify what happens when the condition is true and what happens when it is false. Instead, an assertion has fixed consequences: If the condition is true, nothing happens and the program continues as normal; if the condition is not true, an [exception](extras/glossary.md#exception) is raised.\n",
