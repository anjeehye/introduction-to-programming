    "As you have probably noticed by now, it is easy to make mistakes when writing a computer program. Computers cannot easily guess what it is that we want of them, nor do they have any idea of what sort of things it is reasonable to want to do. So we must give a computer precise, [syntactically correct](extras/glossary.md#syntax) instructions that represent exactly what we want to do, and if we get this wrong, the computer will either be unable to do as we asked, in which case our program will break off with an [error](extras/glossary.md#error), or it will happily carry out the instructions we gave it, even when these are not actually the instructions that we wanted to give, and even if we have mistakenly instructed it to do something stupid or malicious such as emailing the contents of our downloads folder to our boss. It is therefore important to check our programs carefully for mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Up until now, we have been able to check a program fairly easily by simply running it, if it is just a [script](extras/glossary.md#script), or importing it and then using its functions in the console if it is a [module](extras/glossary.md#module). But this sort of informal testing can only take us so far. Once we start writing programs that may take multiple different actions depending on user input, subtle mistakes may be difficult to detect in a quick informal test, because they only arise for some inputs and not others. For these reasons, most software developers test their programs systematically as they go along. Instead of testing a program manually, they write yet another program whose only purpose is to test the main program. This test program tries out the main program with different inputs, and verifies that its behavior is as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing test programs can be tedious. As if we didn't already have enough work to do writing the main program, we now have to write another one that won't even be part of the finished product. It is tempting to dispense with testing, especially if a project is small. But we should not. Good tests act as a reasonable guarantee that our program is correct. And as the saying goes: Most customers prefer a product that actually works.\n",
